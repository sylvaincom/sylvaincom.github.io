Since September 2024, I have been a Machine Learning Product Engineer at [:probabl.](https://probabl.ai/), a Parisian-based AI startup that is a spin-off of <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>, the world-famous open-source machine learning Python library.

I contribute to building a product, the <i>Data Scientist Companion</i>, to empower data scientists and companies in mastering their entire data lifecycle.
Feel free to contact me if you are in need of such a product!

Previously, from February to August 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Centre Borelli](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) research lab from [Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) under the supervision of [Laurent Oudre](http://www.laurentoudre.fr).
I worked on the BrevetAI project from [SaclAI School](https://www.dataia.eu/en/saclai-school) ([DATAIA Institute](https://www.dataia.eu/en)), a learning-by-doing pedagogical platform for AI acculturation.

From October 2020 to January 2024, I was a PhD student, also at the Centre Borelli, where I worked on machine learning applied to time series, under the supervision of [Laurent Oudre](http://www.laurentoudre.fr) and [Charles Truong](https://charles.doffy.net/).
More precisely, my research focused on symbolic representation for time series, as well as distance measures on them.
