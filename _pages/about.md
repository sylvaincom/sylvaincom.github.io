Since September 2025, I have been the co-founding CEO of <a href="https://formel.ai">Formel AI</a>. We build reliable, transparent, and efficient Large Language Models. For this, we leverage the verification capabilities of formal methods, such as the Lean 4 theorem prover.

Previously, I was a Senior ML Product Engineer at [Probabl](https://probabl.ai/) (2024-2025), the startup spin-off from Inria and official operator of <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>, the most popular open-source machine learning Python library. As one of the first employees at Probabl, I was a core developer of the skore library, while also working on product strategy, outreach, and communication. I hold a PhD from ENS Paris-Saclay (2020-2024) on the topic of machine learning applied to time series. From 2021 to 2024, I was a data science lecturer at Ecole Polytechnique Executive Education, Ecole Polytechnique (X-HEC Data Science for Business MScT), and CentraleSupélec Executive Education.
