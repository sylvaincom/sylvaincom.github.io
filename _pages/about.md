Since February 2024, I have been a postdoctoral researcher at the [Centre Borelli](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) research lab from [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en), under the supervision of [Laurent Oudre](http://www.laurentoudre.fr).
I am working on the BrevetAI project from [SaclAI School](https://www.dataia.eu/en/saclai-school) ([DATAIA Institute](https://www.dataia.eu/en)), a "learning-by-doing" pedagogical platform for AI acculturation.

Previously, I was a PhD student, also at the Centre Borelli, where I worked on machine learning applied to time series, under the supervision of [Laurent Oudre](http://www.laurentoudre.fr) and [Charles Truong](https://charles.doffy.net/).
More precisely, my research focused on symbolic representation for time series, as well as distance measures on them.
I successfully defended my PhD on January 8th, 2024.
